/*** note: the ARM Application Procedure Call Standard (AAPCS) disallows
    clobbering of registers R4 through R11. I believe this means the compiler
    has responsibility to ensure these register values, by the time of procedure exit,
    have been returned to the values they posessed at the time of procedure entry. A
    procedure can modify them in the course of it's operations, so long as it
    restores them before exit.

    However, since the values of these registers can change mid-procedure, the
    kernel must save their current values on the current task's stack at the start
    of each context switch. It must also restore the last values of these registers for
    the next task just before completion of the context switch.

    The context switch also needs to perform similar actions to save and restore values
    of registers which are allowed to be colbered in AAPCS, but these are treated differently
    in part because, they have already been pushed to stack (which one???) via the
    Cortex-M exception stack frame functionality***/
